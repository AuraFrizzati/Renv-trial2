## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r libraries, include=FALSE}

library(TraMineR) ## Sequence analysis (and example datasets)


## data wrangling/plotting
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)


```

```{r}
data(mvad)
# create vector of state names (alphabet)
mvad.shortlab <- c("EM", "FE", "HE", "GA", "SC", "TR")

# create vector of state labels (for plots)
mvad.lab <- c("Employment", "Further Education", "Higher Education", "Gap", "School", "Training")

## create the state sequence object (matrix of states + attributes: state alphabet and labels)
mvad.seq<-TraMineR::seqdef(mvad, 17:86, states = mvad.shortlab, labels = mvad.lab)

## set colour palette for sequence states
TraMineR::cpal(mvad.seq)<-c("green","blue", "red", "yellow","cyan", "grey")
```
```{r}
seqdplot(mvad.seq, border = NA, with.legend = "right", cex.legend = 0.8)
```
